FARM ACCESS
===========

Provides mechanisms for managing farmOS user access permissions.

This module is part of the [farmOS](http://drupal.org/project/farm)
distribution.

DEPENDENCIES
------------

**Requires Drupal core patch!**

Note that this module depends on a patch to Drupal core that ensures vocabulary
names are used in the naming of permissions, rather than vocabulary IDs (which
can vary from site to site).

Here is the patch: http://www.drupal.org/files/issues/995156-5_portable_taxonomy_permissions_0.patch

And the related issue thread: http://drupal.org/node/995156

If you are using the farmOS distribution, this patch is already included.

INSTALLATION
------------

Install as you would normally install a contributed drupal module. See:
http://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7 for further
information.
